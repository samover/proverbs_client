# Proverbs Client

A simple api client for my [proverbs
api](https://github.com/samover/proverbs_api) written in jQuery. There is also a
React version, which I did just because I could. [Check it
out](https://github.com/samover/proverbs_client/tree/reactify): it's like
swatting a moquito with an elephant.
